# social-network
A social-network API, enabling the creation, updating and deletion of users, the addition and removal of friends, the creation and deletion of thoughts, and the creation and removal of reactions to thoughts.

# User Story
A social-networking company requires a mongoDB-based back-end in order to handle creaton and modification of data. The API has two main document models: Users and Thoughts. Friends are handled as a call to the User model, and reactions are a subset of the Thought model.

# Installation
Download the project, and run npm install.

# Test
When we get there, we will be using Jest. In the meantime, all functionality has been verified using Insomnia.
